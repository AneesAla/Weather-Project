# Weather App with Python and Socket Programming
This is a basic weather app that retrieves weather information based on the user input of a city and state using Python and Socket programming. The app uses OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather information and Nominatim API to get the latitude and longitude of the given city and state.

## Features
- User can enter the name of a city and state to get the current weather information.
- The weather information is displayed in a separate window.
- The app is designed with a dark theme.

## Prerequisites
To run this app, you need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:
- customtkinter
- socket
- json
- threading
- requests

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more weather APIs to get weather information.
- Allow users to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius, Kelvin, etc.)
- Add a feature to display the weather forecast for the next few days.
